Why Trademarks Are Important

Trademarks are important because they help to prevent confusion in the marketplace by distinguishing one entity's products and services from the products and services of another.

For example, when a user sees the Help Center Live mark on the Help Center Live software, the user understands that Help Center Live has either created or endorsed that product, and that the product is subject to the quality control standards of Help Center Live for that product.

If anyone other than Help Center Live were to use an Help Center Live mark to promote a service, users could be misled into thinking that the unauthorized person's products or services were created or endorsed by Help Center Live, or that those products or services met the quality control standards of Help Center Live.


Trademarks And The GNU General Public License

The GNU General Public License (GPL) permits third parties to use and redistribute the underlying software under certain conditions. Such use and/or redistribution of Help Center Live software products are welcomed by Help Center Live, but should be distinguished from the use of the Help Center Live marks.

The GPL does not provide any license or right to use an Help Center Live mark in any form or media. Thus, although a GPL licensee may redistribute the underlying software, a GPL licensee may not use a Help Center Live mark, as in doing so, that does not conform to the Help Center Live trademark policy without written permission of Help Center Live.
