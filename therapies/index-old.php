<h2>Family Group</h2>



<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv" style="display: none;"><p>Our family groups are an integral part of the therapeutic process at New Dawn Treatment Centers.  We understand that addiction does not happen in a vacuum, and its effects are wide reaching, especially in families. When family members are willing and engaged participants in the recovery process, there is potential to bring healing not only to program participant, but also to all family members. Our weekly family groups are a mix of chemical dependency education, process group, and experiential activities.  </p>

<p>Chemical dependency education is a cornerstone of our work at New Dawn. Arming our participants and families with knowledge about the disease and treatment of addiction is vital to our treatment success. The process portion of family group is an important piece because it allows family members to share with others their experiences of living with the addicted person. Through process, program participants normalize one another's feelings in an empathetic and safe space. Participants also provide feedback for one another and coping tools.  Experiential activities create in-the-moment experiences that facilitate communication and emotional healing. </p>
</div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Process Group</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv2"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv2" style="display: none;"><p>
The process group creates a space for program participants to share where they are at in the recovery process, and to address the issues with which they are currently struggling. While facilitated by a therapist, the goal of the process group is to allow participants to listen to one another and provide supportive feedback in a group setting. 

</p></div></div>

<h2>CBT, DBT &amp; ACT</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv4"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv4" style="display: none;"><p>
Through cognitive behavioral interventions we address the distorted thinking and unworkable behavior patterns that permeate addictive processes. Through use of third wave cognitive behavioral  theories such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy, we teach our clients how to live in the present (mindfulness), cope with painful thoughts and emotions (distress tolerance and cognitive defusion), and take actions to create vision for their lives and live out their personal values.
</p></div></div>



<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Supervised Meals</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv6"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv6" style="display: none;"><p>
We understand that your meal group experience is a critical part of the eating disorder recovery process. We also understand that it is common to fear the meal/snack component of the program. Similar to process group, we explore coping skills that ease any distressing thoughts and feelings that may emerge around eating. We help you overcome fear of any and all foods while providing support in taking food risks and increasing your comfort with eating and sharing a meal experience.
</p></div></div>

<h2>Expressive Arts</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv7"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv7" style="display: none;"><p>
	While traditional therapies and medicine do wonders in healing the mind and the body, our soul and spirit experience recovery on  different levels of awareness.  Inherently ethereal, art therapies allow program participants to explore their recovery through the visual arts, movement, drama, music, writing and other creative processes to better understand themselves, their addiction, and the fulfilling life waiting for them in recovery.  These creative forms of self-expression are inner resources for healing and clarity.

</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Self-Acceptance</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv3"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv3" style="display: none;"><p>
	In order for positive change to occur, self-acceptance is critical. How we relate to others and our environment is dependent on how we relate to ourselves. Developing self-compassion ends the blame and critique that interferes with an individual's happiness with one's self. 
</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Body Image</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv8"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv8" style="display: none;"><p>
	Body image is how we feel about and perceive the aesthetics of our own body, as well as how we imagine others perceive us. In line with self-acceptance, learning to accept and cherish our own unique bodies empowers us towards a life of recovery. 
</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Equine Program</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv9"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv9" style="display: none;"><p>
	Equine therapy incorporates a therapeutic relationship with horses to generate emotional growth, and improved communication. Equine therapy encourages self-awareness in program participants. Horses often emulate the behaviors and emotions of the participants through their body language fostering growth in non-verbal communication. The relationship with their equine partner can model the empathy and patience necessary to create positive, healthy relationships with their two-legged peers.
</p></div></div>

<h2>SUP Paddleboard Yoga (Sausalito) </h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv10"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv10" style="display: none;"><p>
The goal of yoga is to unite the mind, body and spirit where one can find harmony and heal themselves. In SUP Yoga, all of the traditional yoga techniques are incorporated exchanging the yoga matt for a stand up paddleboard out on the water. Participants learn to adapt to the motion of the board developing balance and mindfulness.
</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Empowerment</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv11"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv11" style="display: none;"><p>
Empowerment is the process which enables us to fully access our internal power to overcome our external circumstances. Empowered individuals have the ability to consider a range of options, make informed decisions about their personal situation, and possess the positive thinking to create change.
</p></div></div>

<h2>Holistic Nutrition</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv12"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv12" style="display: none;"><p>
The quality of our food can influence our moods, thoughts and actions. Food not only provides the energy needed to function throughout our day but it is responsible for restoring our bodies' daily wear and tear. Incorporating natural and organic foods can increase the nutrients that are essential to produce the natural chemicals that keep our bodies in balance. Using a non-dieting, holistic approach based on intuitive eating, our Registered Dieticians help restore eating behaviors to ensure a safe and healthy normalization of body weight.
</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Intuitive Eating</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv13"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv13" style="display: none;"><p>
	Unlike chemical addiction, abstinence from food is not a viable option. The goal in developing intuitive eating habits is make peace with food and re-engage the inner signals for hunger and fullness. Your worth as a person is constant and not dependent on your choice to eat a carrot stick over a sandwich. It is important to acknowledge what your body needs and wants for it to do its job. Mindfulness techniques help our program participants make the mind/body connection and promote a healthy relationship with food.
</p></div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Organic Foods</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv14"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv14" style="display: none;"><p>
Fresh organic ingredients and customized meal plans are designed by our Registered Dietitians and chef prepared to guarantee a positive, healthy eating experience. Our Residential programs provide 4 week menu cycle that incorporate a wide variety of dishes to expand the palate. Cooking classes teach program participants to make their favorite recipes at home.
