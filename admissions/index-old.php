<h1>Admissions</h1>

<h2>Comprehensive Psychological Evaluation and Assessment</h2>
<p>In most cases, the clinical director will perform the psychological evaluation. From there, the clinical recommendations will be made and your treatment options will be discussed.
We have professional relationships with the top inpatient programs on the west coast, and a referral can be made that best fits the needs of our prospective patients when appropriate.</p>
<h2>Insurance Benefit Verification</h2>
<p>Additionally, our intake specialists will discuss all relevant fees and ancillary charges with you prior to admission, so that you are completely aware of your potential financial obligation. </p>
<p>Whether you have a question about a referral or have additional questions about our programs, we are always available to help. If you would like to schedule a free assessment, please call our toll free admissions and information line at (866) 969-4300 to speak with one of our intake specialists. We will do our best to schedule your intake appointment within 24 to 48 hours of your initial request for treatment.</p>

<h2>Intake Process</h2>



<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv" style="display: none;"><p>At New Dawn, our goal is to make the admissions process as efficient and painless as possible, and we accomplish this goal in the following ways. First, in an effort to reduce waiting times most Medically Monitored Detox appointments (at our Sacramento facility) are scheduled within 24 hours of the initial request for admission. All other intakes (Residential, Intensive Outpatient, and Day Treatment) are usually scheduled within 48 to 72 hours.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Free Initial Assessment</h2>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv2"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv2" style="display: none;"><p>
We provide the initial assessment at no cost, so that you can rely on our treatment counseling 
</p></div></div>

<h2>Fly on us!</h2>

	We understand that the decision to enter an addiction rehab program can be filled with much anxiety and apprehension, and we want to make that process as painless as possible. Therefore, if you are flying for your recovery, New Dawn will pay your airfare!  Simply complete the Residential Program (30 days) and upon discharge we will either credit your account or, if you are paid in full, write you a check for the full cost of you airfare (up to $500).  We will also provide free airport transfers to and from the residential rehab facility.

<h2>Financing</h2>

<div id="slidingDiv4" style="display: none;"><p>
Because we are a participating provider with most payers, you will receive the highest benefit level of coverage thereby reducing your overall patient responsibility. 
</p>
<p>For those that plan on paying for their treatment:</p>
<p>Private pay costs are $350 per day for <a href="">intensive outpatient</a> services and $650 per day for <a href="">day treatment (PHP)</a>. This includes all services except psychiatric evaluations. Extended day treatment (from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm) is an additional $350 per day. Psychiatric services are an additional expense. You are required to pay for their portion of the cost at the time of service.</p>
 <h2 align="center">	New Dawn understands that financial issues can be huge barriers to treatment, and we will work with you to minimize those barriers!	 </h2>
          <p><strong>Discounts:</strong> An up-front payment for 60 days or more will qualify for a 15% discount.</p>
          
		$1,200 per diem, 30 day minimum stay.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If a patient discharges early for any reason other than medical necessity, any discounts will be null and void</p>
