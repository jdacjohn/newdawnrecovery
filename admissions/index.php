<h1>Admissions</h1>

<h2>Comprehensive Psychological Evaluation and Assessment for all Eating Disordered clients</h2>
<p>Either the Clinical Director or one of our Primary Therapists will perform the psychological evaluation upon your arrival. From there, the clinical recommendations will be made and your treatment options will be discussed. We have professional relationships with the top inpatient programs on the West Coast, and a referral can be made that best fits the needs of our prospective patients when a higher level of care such as hospitalization is appropriate. 
<br /><br />
If you are not sure whether or not you need our help, or what level of care is most appropriate, call us to receive a free, confidential assessment either in person or over the phone â€“ whichever is more convenient for you. 
</p>



<h2>Insurance Benefit Verification</h2>

<p>Additionally, our intake specialists will discuss all relevant fees and ancillary charges with you prior to admission, so that you are completely aware of your potential financial obligation. 
</p>
<p>Whether you have a question about a referral or have additional questions about our programs, we are always available to help. If you would like to schedule a free assessment, please call our toll free admissions and information line at (866) 969-4300 to speak with one of our intake specialists. We will do our best to schedule your intake appointment within 24 to 48 hours of your initial request for treatment.
