<h1>Recovery Guarantee</h1>

<p>Relapse is a natural part of recovery for many, however when a person is not prepared and lacks adequate professional and social support, a relapse can often lead to a full blown recurrence of destructive behaviors. While it is inconceivable for any program to promise a &quot;cure&quot; for chronic conditions like drug and alcohol abuse or eating disorders, we can make a commitment to be there for you when you need us most â€“ during that first six months of recovery when the risk of relapse is highest.<br />
  <br />
  Therefore, in the event that a relapse or recurrence of destructive behaviors occurs during the first six months of your recovery, we will cover your costs to attend our 30 day Relapse Prevention Residential program. New Dawn also provides continuing care support in the form of weekly aftercare groups and bi-monthly counseling sessions by phone, free of charge, as part of our commitment to your successful recovery.</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have completed our 90 day Residential Program for either Chemical Dependency or Eating Disorder, with no outstanding balance owed.</li>

<li>Your "relapse" must be ongoing, and not be a one-time event from which you were able to recover.</li>

<li>New Dawn retains the right to refuse re-admission to any individual who was discharged for noncompliance with program rules, inappropriate behavior, or harm or threats of harm to other clients and/or staff in order to ensure the safety and successful recovery of our existing Residential clients.</li>

<li>Any required Detoxification, physician fees, labs, or prescriptions are excluded from this offer, and must be paid upon re-admission.</li>

<li>If you have insurance, we will bill your insurance for your stay, and scholarship all of your out-of-pocket costs.</li></ul>
