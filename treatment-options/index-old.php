<h1>Our Treatment Programs</h1>

<p>At New Dawn, treatment is collaborative rather than imposed, and we strive for our relationships with you to be characterized by genuineness, trust, and respect. We emphasize a "here-and-now" approach to recovery, believing that the interpersonal issues that occur while in treatment often manifest themselves in every area of your life and, therefore, warrant a great deal of sensitivity, exploration, and feedback. We teach you empirically-supported therapeutic techniques and give ample opportunities to practice these new tools. Here is a list of common tools acquired in treatment at New Dawn.</p>

<h2>Residential Treatment Program</h2>

<a name="RTP"></a>
<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv" style="display: none;"><p>Our residential program offers a therapeutic community whose mission is to offer a supportive and structured environment from which to overcome eating disorders, chemical dependency and other related mental health symptoms.</p>

<p>Our community offers a safe environment with a clear set of guidelines and expectations where you will have the opportunity to learn and practice positive coping skills. Traditional individual, family, and group psychotherapy, supervised meals/snacks (eating disorder program), nutritional counseling (eating disorder program), and medical and psychiatric monitoring are integral to the treatment, as well as more creative and holistic modes of healing such as expressive arts, movement therapy and meditation.</p>

<h2> Day Treatment or PHP (Partial Hospitalization)</h2>


<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv2"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv2" style="display: none;"><p>Day Treatment consists of 6-8 hours of treatment per day and available five days a week. Individual therapy and family counseling sessions are included as needed. The program is designed for those who need additional structure, support, and supervision in order to sustain or stabilize their recovery process or for individuals who may be transitioning from inpatient or residential treatment. PHP can prevent hospitalization for some. Most individuals step down to our <a href="#IOP">intensive outpatient program</a> after completing our day treatment program.</p>

<h2>Intensive Outpatient Treatment Program</h2>


<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv3"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv3" style="display: none;"><p>Intensive outpatient treatment clients participate in our program 3 hours a day, Monday through Saturday. The program is designed for those who need more structure and support than a typical outpatient program, or for those who may be transitioning from our <a href="#PHP">day treatment program</a> or our <a href="#RTP">residential treatment program</a>. The intensive outpatient program provides comprehensive treatment while allowing you to retain autonomy in your normal day-to-day activities.</p>

<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>


<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv4"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv4" style="display: none;"><p>While in the day treatment program, you will continue to be treated by your primary care physician. Your physician will receive weekly information about your progress and medical state. In addition, you will be monitored while in the program by our registered nurse. The nurse will interact with your physician to ensure that you are receiving appropriate medical supervision.</p>

<h2> Psychiatric Treatment</h2>

<div id="slidingDiv5" style="display: none;"><p>Upon entering into the day treatment program, you may receive a psychiatric evaluation by our psychiatrist. This service is an additional expense and is not part of the daily rate. Additional treatment by the psychiatrist will be arranged on an individual basis depending on your needs.</p>

<h2>Outpatient Housing</h2>



<a href="#" class="show_hide" rel="#slidingDiv7"><img src="../images/PlusSign.png" width="113" height="33" alt="Plus Sign"></a>

<div id="slidingDiv7" style="display: none;"><p>New Dawn offers two housing options for those participating in our Eating Disorder day treatment program who live outside the San Francisco and Roseville areas. The housing is available for either short term weekly stays or long term stays.</p>
	
<p>In Sausalito at our Serenity House, clients are walking distance away from our outpatient eating disorders center where we offer a partial and full day treatment. Serenity House is a spacious two-unit duplex with a large back yard and generous front patio. One unit has two bedrooms and two baths; the other has two bedrooms and three baths, allowing for a sense of privacy while still sharing space with other women who are peer support during recovery.</p>

<p>A short walk from Serenity House puts you at the water's edge where you can watch as boats quietly coast across the San Francisco Bay, set against the magnificent backdrop of the San Francisco skyline. There is moderate supervision provided at the House provided by our House Manager. Sliding scale pricing is available for those experiencing hardship.</p>
 
<p>In Roseville, New Dawn has a contract with Slate Creek Apartment Complex which is also walking distance from our facility. The complex features 3 sparkling pools, beautiful views and is near upscale shopping centers.</p>
