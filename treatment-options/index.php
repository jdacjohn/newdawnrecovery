<h1>Our Treatment Programs</h1>

<p>At New Dawn, treatment is collaborative rather than imposed, and we strive for our relationships with you to be characterized by genuineness, trust, and respect. We emphasize a "here-and-now" approach to recovery, believing that the interpersonal issues that occur while in treatment often manifest themselves in every area of your life and, therefore, warrant a great deal of sensitivity, exploration, and feedback. We teach you empirically-supported therapeutic techniques and give ample opportunities to practice these new tools. Here is a list of common tools acquired in treatment at New Dawn.</p>

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Detox</h2>
Few Inpatient programs can provide Detox services in a setting that is separate and distinct from their Residential Program because of the expense involved with more real-estate and additional staff.

<div id="slidingDiv8" style="display: none;">
<p> However, because our goal is to provide the maximum level of privacy and confidentiality, our Detox houses are separate from our Residential Treatment facilities, yet only by a block so that all the services and support provided by the Residential Programs are also available to the Detox patients.</p>
<p>
Our program has its own dedicated 24-hour staff consisting of a nurse, a certified addiction counselor and medical assistants. It is designed to provide a safe, comfortable environment that supports the needs of those requiring sub-acute medical care. Typically, the detoxification period ranges from 7-14 days depending on each individual's physical and psychological condition and the rate at which they progress through the withdrawal period.

<a name="residential"></a>
<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Residential Treatment Program</h2>
Our residential programs provide supportive, structured therapeutic environments in which to overcome eating disorders, chemical dependency and other related mental health symptoms.  &nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv" style="display: none;">Our community offers a safe environment with a clear set of guidelines and expectations where you will have the opportunity to learn and practice positive coping skills. Traditional individual, family, and group psychotherapy, supervised meals/snacks (eating disorder program), nutritional counseling (eating disorder program), and medical and psychiatric monitoring are integral to the treatment, as well as more creative and holistic 
modes of healing such as expressive arts, movement therapy and meditation.

<div class="ExpandingDiv">
<h2> Day Treatment or PHP (Partial Hospitalization)</h2>
Day Treatment consists of 6-8 hours of treatment per day and is available five to six days per week. &nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv2" style="display: none;">The program is designed for those who need additional structure, support, and supervision in order to sustain or stabilize their recovery process or for individuals who may be transitioning from inpatient or residential treatment. PHP can prevent hospitalization for some. Most individuals step down to our intensive outpatient program after completing our day treatment program.

<h2>Intensive Outpatient Treatment Program</h2>
Intensive outpatient treatment clients participate in our program 3-4 hours a day, Monday through Saturday.&nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv3" style="display: none;">The program is designed for those who need more structure and support than a typical outpatient program, or for those who may be transitioning from our day treatment program or our residential treatment program. The intensive outpatient program provides comprehensive treatment while allowing you to retain autonomy in your normal day-to-day activities.

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h2>Adolescent Chemical Dependency Program</h2>
New Dawn's Adolescent Intensive Outpatient and Partial Hospitalization program is the only outpatient program in the Sacramento area that offers structured drug and alcohol abuse treatment and prevention five nights per week.

<div id="slidingDiv9" style="display: none;"><p>Our treatment philosophy is based on the biopsychosocial model of addiction, which posits that a mix of various biological, psychological, and social factors can play a role in contributing to one's mental and behavioral functioning. Treatment involves the development of an individualized treatment plan based on the unique therapeutic needs of each person. 
<br /><br />
Services include individual and group counseling, weekly parent groups, family therapy, recreational therapy and weekly aftercare groups. The curriculum focuses on the issues that most often contribute to a teenager's drug or alcohol abuse. Some of the topics that are covered include the following: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>emotions and drug use</li>
<li>cravings and urges</li>
<li>healthy living</li>
<li>managing life's difficulties</li>
<li>coping skill development</li>
<li>building self-esteem</li>
<li>Changing Distorted Thinking</li>
<li>developing healthy boundaries</li>
<li>relapse prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>Our counselors are trained and certified in mental health and substance abuse counseling. We bring a wealth of knowledge and experience with a caring attitude to the difficulties that families faces in dealing with mental health and/or substance abuse issues. </p>
 
<p>In addition to accepting most insurances, we also receive up to 100% funding for clients who do not have an insurance benefit under the C.A.R.E. (California Access to Recovery Efforts) program, so please call us if you would like your child to receive a free, confidential assessment.</p>

<a name="aftercare"></a>
<h2>Lifetime Aftercare</h2>
Because our ultimate goal is to provide the treatment and support our clients need in order to <strong>achieve and maintain lasting recovery</strong>, 
New Dawn provides <strong>free</strong> lifetime aftercare to clients that successfully complete their treatment objectives. &nbsp;
<br />

<div id="slidingDiv010" style="display: none;">The aftercare group is facilitated by our certified addiction counselors, and focuses on providing 
<strong>continued support</strong>, for those still struggling with sobriety, relapse prevention, and continued life skills development. It also provides an 
opportunity for alumni to check in and visit with staff and share their stories of <strong>success!</strong>

<h2>Medical Clearance &amp; Monitoring</h2>
While in either the Detox, Residential or Partial Hospitalization level of care, you will be monitored either by a Registered Nurse or Licensed Vocation Nurse as medically necessary.   &nbsp; 

<div id="slidingDiv4" style="display: none;">Our nursing staff will interact with your Primary Care Physician to ensure that you are receiving appropriate medical supervision.

<h2> Psychiatric Treatment</h2>
Upon starting either the Residential, Day Treatment or Partial Hospitalization program, you will receive an evaluation by one of our staff psychiatrists who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of Chemical Dependency, Eating Disorders, and other related co-occurring disorders (unless deemed medically unnecessary by our clinical team). &nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv5" style="display: none;"> The Psychiatrists will coordinate your treatment with both the New Dawn team and any outside providers you prefer in order to ensure that you are receiving the most focused and individualized care throughout your stay.

<h2>Education (adolescents)</h2>
For our adolescent clients, we will work with their school to develop an alternative independent study program where appropriate so that she or he can stay current with their studies while they are focusing on their recovery. &nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv6" style="display: none;">We can also provide study periods during the day to allow them an opportunity to do school work and/or meet with a teacher or tutor, if needed.

<div class="ExpandingDiv">
<h2>Outpatient Housing</h2>
New Dawn offers two housing options for those participating in our Eating Disorder day treatment program who live outside the San Francisco and Roseville areas.&nbsp;

<div id="slidingDiv7" style="display: none;"><p>The housing is available for either short term weekly stays or long term stays.</p>
	
<p>In Sausalito at our Serenity House, clients are walking distance away from our outpatient eating disorders center where we offer a partial and full day treatment. Serenity House is a spacious two-unit duplex with a large back yard and generous front patio. One unit has two bedrooms and two baths; the other has two bedrooms and three baths, allowing for a sense of privacy while still sharing space with other women who are peer support during recovery.</p>

<p>A short walk from Serenity House puts you at the water's edge where you can watch as boats quietly coast across the San Francisco Bay, set against the magnificent backdrop of the San Francisco skyline. There is moderate supervision provided at the House provided by our House Manager. Sliding scale pricing is available for those experiencing hardship.</p>
 
<p>In Roseville, New Dawn has a contract with Slate Creek Apartment Complex which is also walking distance from our facility. The complex features 3 sparkling pools, beautiful views and is near upscale shopping centers.</p>
