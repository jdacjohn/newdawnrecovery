                    </li>
                    <li> New Dawn intends to create an environment that fosters ethical conduct, where no employee will ever feel the need to compromise personal integrity to help achieve the organization&rsquo;s mission.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li> New Dawn&rsquo;s Code of Conduct sets forth values, ethical principles, and ethical standards by which actions can be judged; however, the organization cannot guarantee ethical behavior, only that every reasonable attempt will be made to resolve ethical issues or dispute if and when they arise. <br />
                    </li>
                    <li> New Dawn&rsquo;s Code of Conduct is applicable to all staff, consultants, and contractual employees, regardless of their professional functions, the settings in which they work, or the population they serve.<br />

                    <li> New Dawn employees are expected to comply with the ethical codes of conduct outlined by their respective licensing or certifying boards (where applicable), as well as those included in this document.</li>
                  </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li> Marketers must do no harm. This means doing work for which they are appropriately trained or experienced so that they can actively add value to their organizations and customers. It also means adhering to all applicable laws and regulations and embodying high ethical standards in the choices they make.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <hr size="1" />

                    <li> Program facilities will be renovated, and interior fixtures such as lighting, appliances, water sources such as toilets, showers, faucets and water-heaters, and HVAC systems including the use of energy efficient thermostats will be upgraded and/or replaced in order to reduce the organization&rsquo;s carbon footprint.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li> Rules will be established and implemented with regards to energy usage by the persons served and staff in order to limit unnecessary energy consumption and/or energy waste without sacrificing environmental comfort.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li> Staff will at all times make efforts to be mindful of energy as a valuable, limited resource, and will make every effort possible to conserve energy use whenever the opportunity arises.  Examples of energy conservation include turning off lights and fans when leaving a room, keeping all doors and windows shut so as to preserve ambient temperatures and maximize the effectiveness of the HVAC systems, recycling, and providing a proper orientation to the persons served with regards to the value New Dawn places on energy conservation and the ways in which they can contribute to our organizations efforts to be environmentally responsible.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li> When available, New Dawn will participate in the use of renewable energies to the extent that the costs of doing so will be not be a detriment to the quality of services offered.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li> New Dawn will market it&rsquo;s successes in reducing it&rsquo;s reliance on carbon based energies so as to encourage other treatment providers to be more proactive in their decisions to become more environmentally responsible.</li>
