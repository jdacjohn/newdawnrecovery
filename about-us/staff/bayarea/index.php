<!--Nader-->

<div class="ExpandingDiv">

<h3 class="staff">Nader Armanios</h3>
<div class="staffTitles">
   <strong><em>Nutrition Assistant</em></strong>   
</div>

<div id="slidingDiv6" style="display: none;">
<p>Nader graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor of Science in Dietetics and Food Management. He believes that nutrition is not just about the food we eat, it is about the life we live.  Having grown up in a 3rd world country, Egypt, Nader has seen how the health system in such countries is so deficient in varied ways especially nutrition. Therefore, he chose this field as he felt there would be an opportunity for him to contribute and make an impact knowing that nutrition plays a great and vital role in the recovery process of any disease state, as it goes hand-in-hand with medicine, and neither can substitute one another.</p>
<p>Nader has a wide range of experiences in the field of nutrition, stretching from research to clinical. He worked in a few clinical settings where he assisted patients in diet planning and menu consultation. He also explored the field of research through the University of California San Francisco, where he studied the effect of the community and neighborhoods on type II diabetics. Working with people has always been Nader’s passion, and seeing the change in the people he works with gives him the motivation to work harder and achieve his end goals. Consequently, he chose to take on a new challenge at New Dawn; he realized that working with eating disorder patients would help him bring together two of his greatest interests, nutrition and the involvement in bettering people’s lives.</p>
