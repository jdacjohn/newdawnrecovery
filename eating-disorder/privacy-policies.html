					  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					  <h4>Insurance Billing and Patient Responsibility </h4>
					  <blockquote>
                        <p>New Dawn will bill your insurance or  third party payer as a courtesy to you and will make every effort to obtain  payment.&nbsp; Only after reasonable attempts  to collect from the insurance payer have been exhausted will unpaid charges be  billed to the patient.&nbsp; While it can  sometimes take months to exhaust all reasonable avenues of appeal, no interest  will accrue on unpaid insurance charges.&nbsp;  Once unpaid insurance charges have been billed to the client, any unpaid  amounts may be turned over to a collection agency at thirty (30) days past due,  and all legal and collection related fees will be charged to the patient.</p>
					    <p>All anticipated  uninsured/non-covered charges and projected co-payments are expected to be paid  upon admission. New Dawn will make every effort to acquire accurate insurance  benefits and eligibility information, however statements made by the Intake  Department or other New Dawn Recovery Centers staff with regards to copay,  coinsurance, deductible amounts, eligibility, coverage(s), benefit limitations  or exclusions and other health insurance or third party payer related  information are offered only as an estimate of the patient or guarantor&rsquo;s  financial responsibility. It is ultimately the patient&rsquo;s responsibility to know  the extent of their health insurance eligibility and coverage. The patient  and/or guarantor is responsible to pay for all non-covered services, which  includes any portion of the billed charges that are not paid by the insurance  payer. </p>

                            <strong>Understanding Your Health  Record/Information:</strong><br />
                          Each time you visit a health care facility, physician, or other healthcare  provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains  information about your health history, symptoms, examination and test results,  diagnoses, treatment, and a plan for future care or treatment. This  information, often referred to as your patient chart or medical record, serves  as a: </p>
					    <ul>
                          <li>Basis for planning your care       and treatment. </li>
					      <li>Means of communication among       the health professionals who contribute to your care. </li>
					      <li>Legal document describing the       care you received. </li>
					      <li>Means by which you or a third       party payer can verify that services billed were actually provided. </li>
					      <li>Tool in educating heath       professionals. </li>
					      <li>Source of personally       de-identified data for medical research. </li>
					      <li>Basis of de-identified       information for public health officials charged with improving the health       of the local region or the nation. </li>

					      <li>Tool with which we can assess       and continually work to improve the care we render and the outcomes we       achieve. </li>
				        </ul>
					    <p>Understanding what is in your record  and how your health information is used helps you to: </p>
					    <ul>
                          <li>Insure its accuracy. </li>
					      <li>Better understand who, what,       when, where and why others may access your health information, especially       in the event that you did not sign a specified authorization to do so. </li>
					      <li>Make more informed decisions       when authorizing disclosure to others. </li>
				        </ul>
					    <p><strong>Your Health Information Rights:</strong><br />
					      Although your health record is the physical property of the healthcare  practitioner or facility that compiled it, the information belongs to you. You  have the right to: </p>
					    <ul>
                          <li>Request a restriction on       certain uses and disclosures of your information as provided by 45 CFR       164.522 and 42 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 2. </li>
					      <li>Obtain a paper copy of the       notice of information practices upon request. </li>

					      <li>Obtain an accounting of       disclosures of your health information as provided in 45 CFR 164.528. </li>
					      <li>Request communications of       your health information by alternative means or at alternative locations. </li>
					      <li>Revoke your authorization to       use or disclose health information, except to the extent that action has       already been taken based on a previous authorization. </li>
				        </ul>
					    <p><strong>Our Responsibilities:</strong><br />
					      This organization is required to: </p>
					    <ul>
                          <li>Maintain the privacy of your       health information. </li>

					      <li>Notify you if we are unable       to agree to a requested restriction. </li>

					  <h4>Notice - Confidentiality of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records </h4>
					  <blockquote>
                        <p>The confidentiality of alcohol and drug  abuse patient records maintained by this program is protected by federal law  and regulations (per 42 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 2). Generally, the program may not  say to a person outside the program that a patient attends the program, or  disclose any information identifying a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser  unless: </p>
					    <ol>
                          <li>The patient consents in       writing. </li>
					      <li>The disclosure is allowed by       a court order. </li>
					      <li>The disclosure is made to       medical personnel in a medical emergency or to designated and qualified       staff for research, audit, or program evaluation. </li>
				        </ol>
					    <p>Federal law and regulations do not  protect any information about a crime committed by a patient either at the  program or against any person who works for the program or about any threat to  commit such a crime. <br />
					      Federal laws and regulations do not protect any  information about suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under  State law to appropriate state or local authorities. </p>
					    <p>Violation of the federal  law and regulations by a program is a crime. Suspected violations may be  reported to appropriate authorities in accordance with federal regulations. </p>

					  <h4>Individual Right to Access Protected Health Information </h4>
					  <blockquote>
                        <p>The individual patient/client has a  right to access, inspect and obtain a copy of his/her protected health  information (pursuant to 45 CFR Part 164.524) for as long as that designated  record set is maintained by the facility. Access will be accorded within 30  days of the request, except in where legally specified reasons for denial  exist. If access is denied for cause, such denial may be reviewed and appealed. <br />
                          For further HIPAA-relevant Privacy information see the U.S.  Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) CMS <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/" target="_blank"><strong>website</strong></a>.</p>
					    <p>We reserve the right to  change our practices and to make the new provisions effective for all protected  health information we maintain. Should our information practices change, we  will post a revised notice to this website. </p>

                        <p>If have questions and would like additional information,  you may contact New Dawn Recovery Centers&rsquo; corporate office at 866-969-4300.<br />
                          If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you  can file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services/ Office  for Civil Rights (HHS/OCR) by email at <a href="mailto:ocrcomplaint@hhs.gov"><strong>ocrcomplaint@hhs.gov</strong></a> or by calling the national Office at 202-205-8725 and asking for the OCR Health  Information Privacy Complaint Form and/or for the appropriate Regional OCR  Office.</p>
					    <p>However, communications  that are sent directly to the Department of HHS/OCR are maintained by them for  historical purposes, as required by law. Those communications are archived on a  monthly basis, but are also protected by the Privacy Act, which restricts their  use while permitting certain disclosures. There will be no retaliation for  filing a complaint. </p>
